# Disclaimer ( Boring Legal Crap )
This is my own personal work (Brian Fukushima), and does not represent that of my employer.  
All work done in this library represents my own personal designs, code, resources spent, etc.
Please do not contact my employer with any questions/comments/concerns pertaining to this
library, but rather please contact me directly if you have any questions/comments/concerns.

The work in this library represents my learning path from scripting towards Software Engineering.
There will be many questionable choices made, and things that many of you find incredibly idiotic.
Chances are, I just fucked up and plead ignorance, so please let me know if you  find anything
idiotic in here as it is a learning experience for myself.

This library should be considered to be Open Source and available to use as you see fit, however
all original copyrights for designs and what not are still mine.  I'm too lazy to do the research
on the licensing and what not, as I quite frankly don't really care that much about reading into as
it's not the most exciting novel ever written.

Cheers, 

Me
