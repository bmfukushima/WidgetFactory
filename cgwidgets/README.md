# Disclaimer ( Boring Legal Crap )
This is my own personal work (Brian Fukushima), and does not represent that of my employer.  
All work done in this library represents my own personal designs, code, resources spent, etc.
Please do not contact my employer with any questions/comments/concerns pertaining to this
library, but rather please contact me directly if you have any questions/comments/concerns.

Due to the fact that I even have to write out this boring legal-ish part of this library,
I don't it would be wise to just give it away for free and release it into the wild for anyone to use
as they see fit.  So...  As of this point in time, this library is free to anyone who will be using it to
build upon an existing proprietary platform, or a commercial solution.  However, unfortunetly since
I don't feel like dealing with a bunch of legal crap, "polite" requests, or "gentle" reminders, I think
it will be wise to restrict the redistribution of this work in any form at this point in time.  

Basically:
  * Copy: Yes
  * Modify: Yes
  * Use: Yes
  * Redistribute/Distribute: Nerp ( That's no but said sarcastically for people that don't get points.
		But it really does mean no, it does not mean please keep asking me in different tones until
		the answer changes ).  This also includes modified/copied versions of this library.
  * Sublicense: Nerp (I don't even know what sublicensing is so I'm just going to do a blanket no atm )
	
Final Note:
The work in this library represents my learning path from scripting towards  Software Engineering.
There will be many questionable choices made, and things that many of you find incredibly idiotic.
Chances are, I just fucked up and plead ignorance, so please let me know if you find anything
idiotic in here as it is a learning experience for myself.

Cheers,
Me
